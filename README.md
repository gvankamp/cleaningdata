Getting & Cleaning Data - Course Project
========================================

This script assumes following packages are installed and loaded:

* tidyr
* dplyr


The final dataset 'final.data' is in the 'long' format; it gives all combinations of activity, subject and variable and the averages for subjects and activities.
This is not the easiest format to read, but is handy for later analysis.
